# INK Go implementation

An independent Go implementation of INK's security-relevant decisions, built to
run the shared conformance vectors in [`../conformance/v1`](../conformance/v1).
It is deliberately not a port of the TypeScript reference: agreement on the same
vectors, reached from different code, is what proves the wire spec is not
accidentally TypeScript-shaped.

## What it covers

The `ink` package implements, and the conformance runner verifies against the
shared vectors:

- **Principal normalization** (`principal.go`, `multibase.go`) — base58btc
  multibase encode/decode and the canonical agent-principal rules, with string
  lengths measured in UTF-16 code units to match the reference contract.
- **Signature base** (`jcs.go`, `signature.go`) — RFC 8785 JCS canonicalization
  (object members sorted by UTF-16 code unit, minimal string escaping), the INK
  signature-base construction, and RFC 8032 strict Ed25519 verification.
- **Replay and freshness** (`replay.go`) — the timestamp freshness window and
  nonce de-duplication.
- **Key rotation** (`multikey.go`) — the multi-key authority rule (hint, then
  active, then retired; revoked and out-of-window keys skipped).

The JCS number profile is out of scope for this version: a number in a signed
body fails closed, and the conformance signed envelopes contain none. Faithful
cross-implementation number canonicalization needs ECMAScript number
formatting and is tracked as future work.

## Running the conformance suite

```sh
cd ink
go test ./...
```

Each `Test*` loads its category from `../../conformance/v1/vectors` and asserts
this implementation makes the expected accept or reject decision on every
vector, plus the canonical principal or verifying key where the vector pins it.
